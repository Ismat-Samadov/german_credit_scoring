# Credit Scoring Model - German Credit Data

A comprehensive credit scoring analysis and machine learning model built on the German Credit dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end credit risk analysis including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Credit score generation (300-850 FICO-style scale)
- Risk categorization and assessment

## 🎯 Key Features

### Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression** (Best performer - ROC-AUC: 0.800)
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

### Comprehensive Metrics
- **Accuracy** - Overall correctness
- **Precision** - Positive predictive value
- **Recall** - Sensitivity/True positive rate
- **F1-Score** - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC** - Area under ROC curve
- **Gini Coefficient** - Model discrimination power (2×AUC - 1)
- **KS Statistic** - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for class separation

### Risk Categories
- **Excellent** (740-850): Very low risk
- **Good** (670-739): Low risk
- **Fair** (580-669): Medium risk
- **Poor** (500-579): High risk
- **Very Poor** (300-499): Very high risk

## 📊 Dataset Information

**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - German Credit Data

**Records**: 1,000 credit applications

**Features**: 20 attributes including:
- Checking account status
- Credit duration
- Credit history
- Credit amount
- Savings account balance
- Employment status
- Age
- Housing status
- And more...

**Target**: Credit risk (Good/Bad)

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Model Performance**: Logistic Regression achieves excellent discrimination with Gini = 0.60 and KS = 0.55
2. **Feature Importance**: Checking account status, credit duration, and credit amount are top predictors
3. **Class Imbalance**: 70% good credit, 30% bad credit - handled with stratified splitting
4. **Practical Application**: Model can effectively rank customers by credit risk

## 📝 Model Interpretation

### Gini Coefficient (0.600)
- Indicates **good model discrimination**
- Range: -1 to 1 (higher is better)
- Interpretation: Model can effectively distinguish between good and bad credit

### KS Statistic (0.552)
- Indicates **excellent class separation**
- Industry benchmark: KS > 0.4 is excellent
- Optimal threshold identified for decision-making
